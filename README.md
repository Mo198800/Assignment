### Information System Components
Amazon is very easy to make an order through their website. First of all, go to www.Amazon.com. Create an account, search whatever you want from milions of products, pick the item, put your address and the payments, Amazon will ship the item to the nearst carrier and then the carrier will ship it directly to your home.Easy process

### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The Purpose of the CPU is guides the computer through the various steps of solving a problem. Data enters the computer through an input unit, is processed by the central processing unit, and is then made available to the user through an output unit., Inside the CPU there is control units receives orders from RAM and the ALU perform mathematical in CPU. There are two inputs and one output the 2 inputs receive instructions from RAM and the output contain of 8 wires register. Register is simply store things like RAM but inside the CPU. It stores numbers temporarily while instruction being processed.  There are 4 things that all computers do Input, store, process, and output each of these things done by a different part of computer. Input converts physical input to binary information then the memory stores information then the CPU calculates information finally output converts information to physical output. When we are using the self-check-out in any grocery store basically what happens it when we scan the barcode (Input) the device sends the barcode translate into a numbers those go directly to the CPU which is translate to identify the item and then send it out as a output with the item picture and price. All this process happens very fast.


#### Gates and Circuits
Computer chips turn inputs into output—ones into zeros and zeros into ones. they work very quickly and simply by writing what's called a truth table. This shows the output you get (one or zero) for every possible input (each separate row of the table describes one of the possible sets of inputs and output).
An AND logic gate works the same way with two electrical inputs. If both inputs are switched on (that is, carry a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise, 	the output will be 0. In electronics, we can represent an AND gate with this little symbol. Three ways in which the gate can work are shown below.
An OR logic gate works this way with two electrical inputs. If either input is switched on (that is, carries a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise, the output will be 0. In electronics, we represent an OR gate with a different symbol

#### IEEE
#### Storage
Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek. It is easily calculated from the spindle speed, being the time for half a rotation. A drive’s average access time is the interval between the time a request for data is made by the system and the time the data is available from the drive. In 1997 Seagate pushed spin speed to a staggering 10,033rpm with the launch of its UltraSCSI Cheetah drive and, in mid-1998, was also the first manufacturer to release an EIDE hard disk with a spin rate of 7,200rpm. In 1999 Hitachi broke the 10,000rpm barrier with the introduction of its Pegasus II SCSI drive. This spins at an amazing 12,000rpm – which translates into an average latency of 2.49ms. Hitachi has used an ingenious design to reduce the excessive heat produced by such a high spin rate. In a standard 3.5in hard disk, the physical disk platters have a 3in diameter. However, in the Pegasus II, the platter size has been reduced to 2.5in. 
By late 2001 the fastest high-performance drives were capable of an average latency of less than 3ms, an average seek time of between 4 and 7ms and maximum data transfer rates in the region of 50 and 60MBps for EIDE and SCSI-based drives respectively.

Hard disk drives with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles, and an array of other complex moving parts. Hard disk drives can be slow disks have to start spinning if they’re not already doing so, then they must get the head to the correct position on the disk to read or write the data. Also, physical problems occurring when a piece of dust or other foreign object gets into the mechanism, or when an impact jolts the drive, and we have a distinctly imperfect system. On the other hand, Solid state (SSD) should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads. Data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. It is then accessed almost instantaneously using unique system-wide addresses. Solid state drives may be preferred over traditional disk drives for several reasons. The first advantage is found, as mentioned briefly above, in the speed of operation. Because hard disk drives need to be spinning for the head to read sectors of the platter, sometimes we must wait for spin up time. Once the disk is spinning, the head must seek the correct place on the disk, and from there the disk must spin just enough so that the correct data is read. If data is spread over different parts of the disk (fragmented) then this operation is repeated until all the data has been read or written. While each individual operation only takes fractions of a second the sum of them may not. It is often the case that reads to and writes from the hard disk are the bottleneck in a system. Because the information on solid state drives can be accessed immediately (technically at the speed of light) there is no latency experience when data is transferred. Because there is no relationship between spatial locality and retrieval speed, there is no degradation of performance when data is fragmented. Solid state drives also enjoy greater stability over their disk counterparts. Because there are no moving parts there is less that can go wrong mechanically. Dust entering the device ceases to become a problem (and in any case solid state drives can be sealed airtight unlike disk drives which require a certain air cushion to function properly), and dropping the drive is less likely to cause damage to the data. There are no heads, so head crashes are a thing of the past.
#### Memory
Increasing RAM impacts computing speed so we load more data without need the slower hard drive 
The difference between 64 bit and 32 bit that 64 bits can transfers 64 bits at a time. DIMM (64 bit) is faster than SIMM(32bit) it can transfer double the amount of the clock cycle.
RAM and HDD, are both types of computer memory. RAM is used to store computer programs and data that CPU needs in real time. RAM data is volatile and is erased once computer is switched off. HDD, hard disk has permanent storage and it is used to store user specific data and operating system file
#### Data Representation
Binary number systems use a base of two while hexadecimal uses a base of 16. In a hexadecimal system, it is necessary to count to 15. To represent the numbers 10 – 15, the letters A – F are used respectively. To distinguish the different number systems, suffixes or subscripts are often used.
