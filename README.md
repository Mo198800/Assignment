## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
Amazon is very easy to make an order through their website. First of all, go to www.Amazon.com. Create an account, search whatever you want from milions of products, pick the item, put your address and the payments, Amazon will ship the item to the nearst carrier and then the carrier will ship it directly to your home.Easy process

### Career Exploration
Tri-c Providing and helping students to get internships in their careers and help them by navigtating them to the right course or class.For examples, I enrolled to cybersecurity degree, I got many emails about what is the need for the market and what others certificate I can get Like comptia, Cisco, etc to help me have a strong skills.

### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The Purpose of the CPU is guides the computer through the various steps of solving a problem. Data enters the computer through an input unit, is processed by the central processing unit, and is then made available to the user through an output unit., Inside the CPU there is control units receives orders from RAM and the ALU perform mathematical in CPU. There are two inputs and one output the 2 inputs receive instructions from RAM and the output contain of 8 wires register. Register is simply store things like RAM but inside the CPU. It stores numbers temporarily while instruction being processed.  There are 4 things that all computers do Input, store, process, and output each of these things done by a different part of computer. Input converts physical input to binary information then the memory stores information then the CPU calculates information finally output converts information to physical output. When we are using the self-check-out in any grocery store basically what happens it when we scan the barcode (Input) the device sends the barcode translate into a numbers those go directly to the CPU which is translate to identify the item and then send it out as a output with the item picture and price. All this process happens very fast.


#### Gates and Circuits
Computer chips turn inputs into outputâ€”ones into zeros and zeros into ones. they work very quickly and simply by writing what's called a truth table. This shows the output you get (one or zero) for every possible input (each separate row of the table describes one of the possible sets of inputs and output).
An AND logic gate works the same way with two electrical inputs. If both inputs are switched on (that is, carry a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise, 	the output will be 0. In electronics, we can represent an AND gate with this little symbol. Three ways in which the gate can work are shown below.
An OR logic gate works this way with two electrical inputs. If either input is switched on (that is, carries a number 1), the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise, the output will be 0. In electronics, we represent an OR gate with a different symbol
